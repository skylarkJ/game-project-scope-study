## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
html5, html5 canvas, css3, JavaScript,  jQuery, json, ajax

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    I would like to use html5 canvas and pare it with JS by canvasClicked call function and canvas methods like moveTo(), lineTo(), stroke(), beginPath(), closePath()

-   How you plan to approach this project.
I am gonna take it as a professional development project. I want to use a version control system Github and am using a trello board to split tasks for development.  If I need to consult something with my GA mates I will use Google share remote. For the documentation I am using Evernote cloud base application.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
I might use sass for styling but not sure yet. Or bootstrap for making the site responsive - but there is not going to be many elements on the page so I think bootstrap with all library code is unnecessary and will just make a whole performance heavy. Keeping it simple with pure html5 will probably be the best way.

- What creative spin will you add to your project?
I would love to add some timed transitions and music on the background not on tiles.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
I will create a repo locally and will turn it to the .git repo by git init. Then I will upload it on my GitHub account by $ git remote add origin and link to my github account with the ending of my local repo. I can verify new remote by $git remote -v  Then I will do the steps that we do at school every day. But I think without the pull requests, just committing. Pull request would be at the end of the project I guess.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
I would be interested how to make a table side chat because I would love to use it for some other project but am not sure if I will have some spare time for it. To add some boost to a styling would be also great. Some animations - transitions would be neat.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
